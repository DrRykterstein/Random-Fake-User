# Random Fake User
Simple beginner project built with HTML, CSS, PHP and vanilla Javascript.

## General Information
A basic website intended for furthering my Javascript skills as well as my ability to interact with Rest API's. The project contains 2 webpages, both of which generate random users based on fake data. CSS styling is scarce with a greater focus on functionality.
